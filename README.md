# ERP-Mode-Processing

Here's the Matlab code used for EEG data (pre)processing and R code used for behavioral data statistical analysis, 
from my bachelor thesis project on mode processing in music.

Some of the code may be underdocumented. 

For a detailed description of the data processing and analysis procedures, as well as the study design and findings, 
take a look at my bachelor thesis (contact me at s.zhao@jacobs-university.de)
